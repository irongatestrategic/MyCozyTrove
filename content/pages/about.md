# About MyCozyTrove

## Who We Are

I'm Jeff, and I've been fishing, camping, and testing outdoor gear across the South for over two decades. From bass boats on Mississippi lakes to backpacking trips in Alabama wilderness, I've learned what gear actually works and what's just marketing hype.

## Our Background

My background in enterprise IT (20+ years managing datacenter systems for Fortune 500 companies) taught me to trust data over claims. I apply that same skepticism to outdoor gear - I test it, use it in real conditions, and tell you what actually performs.

Before focusing on outdoor gear reviews, I ran IronGate Strategic LLC as an enterprise IT consultant, working with VMware, Cisco UCS, and datacenter architecture. That systematic, data-driven approach carries over to how I evaluate fishing and camping equipment.

## Why MyCozyTrove Exists

Most outdoor gear reviews come from people who test products for a weekend and move on. We're different.

**We test what we review.** Every product recommendation comes from actual fishing trips, camping weekends, and outdoor use across Mississippi, Alabama, and the South.

Our reviews feature:
- Gear I've personally tested over multiple trips
- Equipment used by people I trust (like my brother who boondocks regularly)
- Honest assessments of what works for fishermen, campers, and outdoor enthusiasts

## Our Testing Philosophy

### Real-World Conditions
We don't write reviews from product descriptions. Equipment gets tested on actual fishing trips, camping weekends, and backcountry hikes. Performance on the water and in the woods matters more than marketing claims.

### Long-Term Testing
First impressions lie. We test gear over multiple trips, through different seasons and conditions. Equipment that works initially but fails after two months doesn't get recommendations.

### Honest Limitations
Perfect products don't exist. Every review includes:
- What the product cannot do
- What it struggles with
- Who shouldn't buy it
- Real downsides we discovered during testing

### No Sponsored Content
We don't accept payment for reviews. If a manufacturer wants coverage, they can buy advertising like everyone else. Our recommendations come from actual use, not affiliate commission rates.

## Geographic Focus

Our testing takes place primarily in:
- **Mississippi** - Lake fishing, river fishing, rural camping
- **Alabama** - Wilderness backpacking, hunting, outdoor recreation
- **The South** - Hot summers, wet springs, mild winters

This means our gear recommendations work well in:
- Humid conditions
- High summer heat
- Wet weather (rain, morning dew, occasional flooding)
- Mixed terrain (woods, water, mud)

## Expertise Areas

**Fishing:**
- Bass fishing (boat and bank)
- Crappie fishing
- Catfish (trotlines, jug lines, rod & reel)
- Tackle organization and transport
- Fishing boots and waterproof gear

**Camping:**
- Weekend camping (car camping and backpacking)
- Minimalist/ultralight backpacking
- Boondocking (dispersed camping, no facilities)
- Portable power solutions
- Camp cooking and food storage

**Outdoor Gear:**
- Weather-resistant apparel
- Footwear for mixed terrain
- Portable power stations
- Emergency/backup equipment
- Gear organization systems
