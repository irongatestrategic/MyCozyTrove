### Emergency Situations
If you're experiencing an active emergency, contact appropriate authorities:
- **Medical Emergency:** 911

SafeHarborPrep provides preparedness information, not emergency response services.

### Professional Services

### Product Support
For warranty issues, returns, or product-specific technical support, contact manufacturers or retailers directly. We cannot process returns or provide manufacturer technical support.

### Personalized Planning
While we're happy to answer general questions, we cannot provide comprehensive personalized preparedness plans. Consider consulting with professional emergency management advisors for detailed planning.

If you represent a manufacturer and believe your product would interest our audience, you may email us product information. We may choose to purchase and review it independently, but we make no commitments.

- Product name and category
- Why you think it's worth reviewing
- Any specific questions you have about it

We review suggestions but cannot test every product recommended.

We're selective about media opportunities but open to discussions with legitimate outlets.
