## Product Review Requests

### From Manufacturers
We currently purchase all products we review to maintain editorial independence. We do not accept:
- Free product samples for review
- Payment for reviews or coverage
- Sponsored content
- Affiliate relationship influence over editorial content

If you represent a manufacturer and believe your product would interest our audience, you may email us product information. We may choose to purchase and review it independently, but we make no commitments.

### From Readers
We appreciate product suggestions from readers and often prioritize community requests. Email us with:
- Product name and category
- Why you think it's worth reviewing
- Any specific questions you have about it

We review suggestions but cannot test every product recommended.

We're selective about media opportunities but open to discussions with legitimate outlets.
