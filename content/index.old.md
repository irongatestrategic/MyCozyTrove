## Why MyCozyTrove Exists

Most outdoor gear reviews come from people who test products for a weekend and move on. We're different.

**We test what we review.** Every product recommendation comes from actual fishing trips, camping weekends, and outdoor use across Mississippi, Alabama, and the South.

**Our reviews reflect reality:** what succeeds, what fails, what's worth your money when you're miles from the nearest tackle shop.

## Our Testing Standards

### Real-World Use
We don't write reviews from product descriptions—we use gear on actual fishing trips, camping weekends, and backcountry hikes. Performance on the water and in the woods matters more than marketing claims.

### Long-Term Testing
First impressions lie. We test gear over multiple trips, through different seasons and conditions. Equipment that works initially but fails after two months doesn't get recommendations.

### Honest Limitations
Perfect products don't exist. Every review includes what the product *cannot* do, what it struggles with, and who shouldn't buy it.
