# Preparedness That Works When It Matters

## Tested Through Real Emergencies, Not Just Reviews

When Hurricane Francine knocked out power across the South for five days, we learned what actually works versus what just looks good in product photos. SafeHarborPrep shares that hard-earned knowledge—real testing, honest limitations, practical solutions.

**We test what we review.** Every product recommendation comes from actual use during power outages, severe weather, and rural living where help isn't coming quickly.

## Why SafeHarborPrep Exists

Most preparedness advice comes from:
- Affiliate marketers who've never experienced real emergencies
- Survival "experts" living in suburban comfort
- Content farms copying each other's untested recommendations

SafeHarborPrep is different. We're rural residents who:
- Live where power outages last days, not hours
- Understand that help is 45+ minutes away
- Test equipment during actual emergencies
- Admit when gear doesn't work as advertised

Our reviews reflect reality: what succeeds, what fails, what's worth your money.

## Core Focus Areas

### Power Independence
Backup power isn't luxury—it's necessity when storms knock out infrastructure for extended periods. We test:
- Solar generators and portable power stations
- Battery capacity vs. real-world runtime
- Solar panel charging in less-than-perfect conditions
- What actually keeps refrigerators, medical equipment, and communications running

### Water Security
Clean water becomes critical the moment municipal systems fail. Our testing covers:
- Portable filtration systems for various water sources
- Rainwater collection and storage
- Emergency purification methods
- Capacity claims vs. actual performance

### Self-Sufficient Systems
Long-term resilience requires reducing dependence on fragile supply chains:
- Food production and preservation
- Energy alternatives
- DIY systems that actually work
- Knowledge that outlasts equipment

### Reliable Gear
When equipment fails during emergencies, consequences are serious. We evaluate:
- Build quality under actual field conditions
- Performance during temperature extremes
- Longevity beyond the first few uses
- Value vs. marketing hype

## Our Testing Standards

### Real Emergency Use
We don't simulate emergencies—we use equipment during actual power outages, storms, and infrastructure failures. Performance under stress matters more than specifications.

### Long-Term Testing
First impressions lie. We test gear over months, through multiple seasons and conditions. Equipment that works initially but fails after 60 days doesn't get recommendations.

### Honest Limitations
Perfect products don't exist. Every review includes what the product *cannot* do, what it struggles with, and who shouldn't buy it. Honest limitations build trust.

### Comparative Context
We compare products to realistic alternatives and discuss trade-offs. Understanding what you're choosing *between* matters as much as what you're choosing.

### Cost-Benefit Reality
Expensive doesn't always mean better. We evaluate actual value: does performance justify price? Are there better options at different price points?

## Experience Behind the Reviews

SafeHarborPrep draws from:

**Rural Living Experience**  
Years in areas where infrastructure is fragile, help is distant, and self-reliance isn't optional—it's how you survive.

**Real Emergency Response**  
Multiple hurricane power outages lasting 3-7 days. Severe weather events. Infrastructure failures. The gear we recommend is gear we trusted during actual crises.

**Technical Background**  
20+ years in enterprise IT infrastructure provides understanding of systems, reliability, and failure modes. We evaluate equipment with engineering perspective.

**DIY Implementation**  
We build the systems we discuss—root cellars, rainwater collection, solar installations. Theory is worthless. We share what we've actually constructed and lived with.
